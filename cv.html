                <p>My name is Aidan Vian. I am a first year student at the University of Northampton, currently studying for a Web Technology and Security BSc degree. During the 3 year
                course I hope to gain many new skills to help me advance further in the IT industry. I'm keen to gain new skills and experiences and University is the best way to achieve this aim.</p>

            <p> During my free time, I dabble in a variety of things Computing- and Technology-related, including playing video games, researching latest technology, practising
                different coding languages using various different sites. I have a particular interest in Cyber Security and enjoy researching recent Cyber attacks during the last decade.
                I hope to develop my skills in this area as part of my degree as I would love to be employed in the Cyber Security Industry.</p>

            <h5>
        <p> I'm currently studying at the University of Northampton, where I am continuously improving my skills and experiences within IT. I am currently learning JavaScript and have created a few different 
            little programs to test my ability. I've also been learning how to utilise Visual Studio Code to develop websites, like this one.
            I don't have a lot of work experience within the IT industry, however I have a part time job at the Riverside Hub, and this has allowed me to develop and improve other work and life skills,
            such as the ability to work independently, or within a team in a challenging environment, cash handling, operating tills and customer service.
            During my 2 years at college, I took an opportunity for 2 weeks work experience at The Tess Group, where i worked in a busy office, learning other skills, including data entry, making and receiving 
            calls to and from clients and generally getting a feel for working in an office environment.</p>
